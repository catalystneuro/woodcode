# TODO: reorganize metadata between Google Sheet and YAML file once all the metadata has been shared. 
# The idea would be to include all metadata that is constant for the whole cohort in the yaml file, such as keywords.
# All the metadata that varies on a per-subject or per-session basis would be in the Google Sheet, such as genotype.

    description: The rat was awake and foraging for scattered cereal in a cylindrical open field. The recording environment consisted of a cylindrical arena of 73 cm diameter, with 54 cm tall walls, painted light blue. A prominent visual cue was positioned at the top of the wall on the north side; this was 31.5 cm wide and 26 cm tall and consisted of two black horizontal stripes with a white stripe between them.

  sleep:
    description: The rat was given a 90-minute sleep opportunity in a container placed inside the recording arena, during which recordings continued.

      description: Video capturing and marker tracking were performed using Bonsai software 51 at 40 Hz. For the juvenile recordings, images were acquired through a Logitech C930e camera. To synchronise the images with the electrophysiology data, an Arduino microcontroller was programmed to send a random sequence of pulses to both the OpenEphys system and a LED light within the frame of the camera. The times when the LED light shone were detected by Bonsai and synchronisation of the pulses in the light and the electrophysiology data was done offline.

    coordinates: [-6.3, 1.6, -3.1] # mm AP, DV, ML from Bregma, BUT Ventral aka down is positive (also note ML is negative here for left hemisphere)
    reference: A silver ground wire was placed directly above the cerebellum as the reference.
    data_acquisition_description: For recording, the implanted silicon probe was connected to an Intan RHD headstage (Intan technologies). The headstage was connected to an Intan RHD standard SPI cable, which was connected to a 3D-printed commutator in the ceiling (custom-made in house). Signals were acquired at 30kHz with an OpenEphys data acquisition system.
