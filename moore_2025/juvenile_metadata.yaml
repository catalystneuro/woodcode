Task:
  wake:
    description: The rat was awake and foraging for scattered cereal in a cylindrical open field. The recording environment consisted of a cylindrical arena of 73 cm diameter, with 54 cm tall walls, painted light blue. A prominent visual cue was positioned at the top of the wall on the north side; this was 31.5 cm wide and 26 cm tall and consisted of two black horizontal stripes with a white stripe between them.
    environment: cylindrical_open_field
  sleep:
    description: The rat was given a 90-minute sleep opportunity in a container placed inside the recording arena, during which recordings continued.
    environment: sleep_container

      description: Video capturing and marker tracking were performed using Bonsai software 51 at 40 Hz. For the juvenile recordings, images were acquired through a Logitech C930e camera. To synchronise the images with the electrophysiology data, an Arduino microcontroller was programmed to send a random sequence of pulses to both the OpenEphys system and a LED light within the frame of the camera. The times when the LED light shone were detected by Bonsai and synchronisation of the pulses in the light and the electrophysiology data was done offline.
