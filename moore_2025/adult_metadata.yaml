# TODO: reorganize metadata between Google Sheet and YAML file once all the metadata has been shared. 
# The idea would be to include all metadata that is constant for the whole cohort in the yaml file, such as keywords.
# All the metadata that varies on a per-subject or per-session basis would be in the Google Sheet, such as genotype.

  wake:
    description: The rat was awake and foraging for scattered cereal in a cylindrical open field. The recording environment consisted of a cylindrical arena of 73 cm diameter, with 54 cm tall walls, painted light blue. A prominent visual cue was positioned at the top of the wall on the north side; this was 31.5 cm wide and 26 cm tall and consisted of two black horizontal stripes with a white stripe between them.

      description: Video during epoch 1. Video capturing and marker tracking were performed using Bonsai software 51 at 40 Hz. For the adult recordings, images were acquired through an acA1300-75gc Basler camera with a LMVZ4411 Kowa lens, positioned at the ceiling of the rig. This camera was connected to the OpenEphys board, sending a pulse for each frame taken, allowing the synchronisation of the two streams of information.

    coordinates: [-7.64, 1.7, -3.3] # mm AP, DV, ML from Bregma, BUT Ventral aka down is positive (also note ML is negative here for left hemisphere)
    reference: A silver ground wire was attached to one of the skull screws placed above the cerebellum as the reference.
    data_acquisition_description: For recording, the implanted silicon probe was connected to an Intan RHD headstage (Intan technologies). The headstage was connected to an Intan RHD standard SPI cable, which was connected to a 3D-printed commutator in the ceiling (custom-made in house). Signals were acquired at 30kHz with an OpenEphys data acquisition system.
