    description: The rat was awake and foraging for scattered cereal in a cylindrical open field. The recording environment consisted of a cylindrical arena of 73 cm diameter, with 54 cm tall walls, painted light blue. A prominent visual cue was positioned at the top of the wall on the north side; this was 31.5 cm wide and 26 cm tall and consisted of two black horizontal stripes with a white stripe between them.

      description: Video during epoch 1. Video capturing and marker tracking were performed using Bonsai software 51 at 40 Hz. For the adult recordings, images were acquired through an acA1300-75gc Basler camera with a LMVZ4411 Kowa lens, positioned at the ceiling of the rig. This camera was connected to the OpenEphys board, sending a pulse for each frame taken, allowing the synchronisation of the two streams of information.
